# Hand AR Particle Effect using OpenCV & MediaPipe

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create an augmented reality (AR) particle effect that follows hand movements in real-time using computer vision techniques. This project utilizes OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for hand tracking, providing an interactive and visually appealing AR experience.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking.
- Particle effects that dynamically follow the hand movements.
- Easy to run with Python environment setup.
- Utilizes advanced computer vision and machine learning libraries.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `app.py` file.
4. Make sure your camera is accessible.

## Future Work
- Improve particle effects with more interactive elements.
- Add support for multiple hands.
- Optimize for performance on lower-end devices.
